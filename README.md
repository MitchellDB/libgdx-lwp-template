#libgdx-lwp-template#
##template for building LWPs/Daydreams using libgdx.##

this project aims to be a basecode-template to speed up development of android live-wallpapers and daydreams built on [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com).

##Features##
currently the template contains:

- livewallpaper launcher (with support for scrolling/preview)
- desktop launcher (portrait & landscape) for easy debugging/development
- daydream launcher
- shared settings-app with helpers to get/set preferences
- makeScreenshot

##Usage##

If you **can**, please **fork** this repo when working on a LWP. It might help other developers looking for hints. I'll try to keep this template up to date with the latest libgdx (currently 0.9.9)
